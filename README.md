# DM-DDI
worthy of note：


1、After experimental investigation, it is found that the experimental effect is best when three fusions are carried out, so this paper sets up 4 layers with nodes (the number of nodes in each layer is 1716, 2000, 256, 65, respectively)

2、The default is to test for 65 categories of DDI data, when you need to test different scale of ddi class of data, you need to modify the corresponding parameters.
Due to the upload file size limit,It needs generate the embedding files generated by the  pre-trained models in the /data directory, and then select the select the corresponding relationship files in the /graph  directory.

3、after obtained the DM-DDI embeddings,fed it to DNN classfier,just as described in the article.

4、our experiment run on Server ubantu 16,32 cpu,256G.
